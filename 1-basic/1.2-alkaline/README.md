## Exercise 2: Alkaline Earth Metals

Assign a list that contains the atomic numbers and the names of the six alkaline earth metals---barium (56), beryllium (4), calcium (20), magnesium (12), radium (88), and strontium (38)---to a variable called `alkaline_earth_metals`.

1. Write a one-liner that returns the highest atomic number in `alkaline_earth_metals`.
2. Using one of the list methods, sort `alkaline_earth_metals` in ascending order (from the lightest to the heaviest).
3. Transform the `alkaline_earth_metals` into a dictionary using the name of the metals as the dictionary's key.
4. Create a second dictionary containing the noble gases -- helium (2), neon (10), argon (18), krypton (36), xenon (54), and radon (86) -- and store it in the variable `noble_gases`.
5. Merge the two dictionaries and print the result as couples (name, atomic number) sorted in ascending order on the element names.

**Note** that Python's dictionaries neither preserve the insertion order nor are sorted in some way.
