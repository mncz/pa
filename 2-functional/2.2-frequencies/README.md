## Exercise 2: Frequencies

Let's write a module (a pool of functions) that given a quite large text (over than 2000 words) counts how frequent each word occurs in the text. In particular the module should provide the function freqs that given a filename and a number would return a list of words (with their frequencies) that occur more than the given number; the list is sorted by frequency with the higher first.

The text is read from a file and it is a real text with punctuation (i.e., commas, semicolons, ...) that shouldn't be counted.

**Note** that words that differ only for the case should be considered the same.
